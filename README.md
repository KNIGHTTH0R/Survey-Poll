 This is an open source online survey application written in PHP based on a MySQL or MSSQL database. 
 It enables users without coding knowledge to develop, publish and collect responses to surveys. 
 Surveys can include branching the acronym CRUD (create, read, update and delete) which refers 
 to all of the major functions that are implemented in relational database applications. Each 
 letter in the acronym can map to a standard SQL statement and can provide basic statistical 
 analysis of survey results. # Survey-Poll
